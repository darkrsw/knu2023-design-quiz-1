CommPy
==================================

CommPy is an open source package implementing digital communications algorithms
in Python using NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.

- MAP Decoder for Convolutional Codes (Based on the BCJR algorithm).
- Encoder for a rate-1/3 systematic parallel concatenated Turbo Code.
- Turbo Decoder for a rate-1/3 systematic parallel concatenated turbo code (Based on the MAP decoder/BCJR algorithm).
- Binary Galois Field GF(2^m) with minimal polynomials and cyclotomic cosets.
- Create all possible generator polynomials for a (n,k) cyclic code.
- Random Interleavers and De-interleavers.
